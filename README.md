This repository contains three folders that include the codes that I worked on so far: Object detection, Sentiment analysis and Emotion detection.

## Object Detection:
Contains the python code, sample of video as an input, output sample, coco name as a dataset for model configuration and yolo3.cfg as a model configuration. You need to download the pre-trained weights for Yolo3 from below links and paste them to Object detection folder and then run the code to check the result yourself

## BertKtrainEmotion.ipynb
Contains the code to apply on text for Emotion detection. To run this code you need to have the pre-trained model which I trained on the IMDB dataset, the sample of data (comments) as input. I saved the pre-trained model and datasets on the Emotion.Detection.GitHub folder.

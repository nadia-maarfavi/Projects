
This repository contains three folders that include the codes that I worked on so far: Object detection, Sentiment analysis and Emotion detection.

## Object.Detection.GitHub:
Contains the python code, sample of video as an input, output sample, coco name as a dataset for model configuration and yolo3.cfg as a model configuration. You need to download the pre-trained weights for Yolo3 from below links and paste them to Object detection folder and then run the code to check the result yourself

## BertKtrainEmotion.ipynb
Contains the code to apply on text for Emotion detection. To run this code you need to have the pre-trained model which I trained on the IMDB dataset, the sample of data (comments) as input. I saved the pre-trained model and datasets on the Emotion.Detection.GitHub folder. 

## BertKtrainSentimen.ipynb
Contains the code to apply on text for sentiment analysis. To run this code you need to have the pre-trained model which I trained on the IMDB dataset, the sample of data (comments) as input. I saved the pre-trained model and datasets on the Sentiment.Analysis.GitHub folder. 

## Emotion.Detection.GitHub
Contains the sample of input dataset, sample of output and pretrained model. You need to sava all this files into the same location of .ipynb file to be able to run the code. The python code works with Google Colab, so you can save the file on your google drive.

## Sentiment.Analysis.GitHub
Contains the sample of input dataset, sample of output and pretrained model. You need to sava all this files into the same location of .ipynb file to be able to run the code. The python code works with Google Colab, so you can save the file on your google drive.
